# Installing IntelÂ® Software Guard Extensions SDK - SSL lib - PSW

This document is friendly guide for installing 
Intel SGX SDK ([link](https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx/sdk))
Intel SGX PSW 
Intel SGX SSL library  ([link](https://github.com/intel/intel-sgx-ssl))

please ignore any grammatical mistakes, since this was a quick guide for installing and I didn't found any good documentation (Especially for the SGXSSL library) for installing. Therefore, I made this guide for anyone who needs to start working with the SDK or library.

happy hacking!
